title:Prioritisation

To prioritize it is hard. Most people are quite bad at it and want to avoid it. Saying no to something feels bad. The problem is that people feel that to prioritize the thing not do do is not important and then we end up with a long list of important stuff all with highest priority. But choosing between a good and a bad thing is not prioritization prioritization is the art of choosing between many important things. And prioritization is not about saying no it is saying "not now". Another thing that causes problems is our tendencies to simpify things by prioritizing to big things where we would benefit from breaking things down. Say we have two initiatives *A* and *B* *A* has top priority and *B* has a lower priority but that does not mean that all things in *A* should have higher priority than all things in initiative *B*.
