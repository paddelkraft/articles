title: Sustainable pace
---

Sustainable pace is a core concept in all Lean/Agile ways of working. What is meant with that is that
we should deliver things at a speed that we can sustain over long periods of time without accumulating 
technical debt. Lean expresses this as "Build quality in". The reasoning behind this is that lowering 
quality is like borrowing delivery capacity from the future and that loan has to be paid back with interest 
wich will make future deliveries significantly slower and more expensive. 

There are ways to avoid overcommiting built into all agile frameworks. In Scrum its the sprint planning
where we are suposed to only bring in as much work as we have been able to complete in previous iteration/iterations.
In Kanban this is achieved with wip limits and only pulling in new work on completion of something that 
has been ongoing. Both of these methods emphasises the importance of a clear definition of done to handle
the build quality in.

This causes friction in many organizations as the learned behavour in management is that if the team says they 
can deliver 10 stories it is considered good practice to ask for 15. Another factor making it even more confusing 
is that  Scrum calls their iterations Sprints which does not signal sustainability at all. 
Many teams feel they have to over commit and this drives a lot of really bad things. It leeds to lost innovation 
ability, techical debt, burnout, lowers collaboration in the team, prevents improvements, people turnover and in 
the end a team that will get slower and slower with time.
 
To avoid this the first and foremost thing to do is to understand your true delivery capacity and 
apply prioritisation functionality slizing and limit WIP to make sure to deliver the most important/valuable stuff first. 
Dan North has expressed the intention really well. Agile is about delivering valuable software sooner not faster.
The number two and harder part is to try to limit your promising to the near future and not to commit to things 
that fill up the whole capacity. There are strictly economic reasons to limit your promises as well. No one wants to 
sit with a commited plan for the upcoming year and a product bogged down with technical debt when the opportunity of 
the decade suddenly comes along. Because sometimes you really have to do unsustanable things. The important thing to 
remember is to do it when it really matters and when we do we need to pay the debt back fast.
